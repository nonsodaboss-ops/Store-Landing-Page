Design Choices Overview

Minimalist Layout: The page uses a clean, uncluttered structure with clear sections for Products, About, and Contact. This improves readability and user focus.

Featured Product Cards: Each product is presented as a distinct card with a name, description, and call-to-action ("Shop Now"). This modular design makes it easy to scan and update.

Consistent Typography: Headings and body text follow a consistent hierarchy, helping users navigate the page intuitively.

Tailwind CSS Styling: Utility-first classes from Tailwind CSS were used to quickly style elements with responsive spacing, shadows, and hover effects — ensuring a modern look without writing custom CSS.

Responsive Imagery: Product images are sized and cropped using Tailwind’s object-cover and w-full h-48 classes, maintaining visual consistency across devices.

Call-to-Action Buttons: “Shop Now” buttons are styled with hover transitions and rounded corners to encourage interaction and improve user experience.

Footer Simplicity: The footer includes a copyright notice, keeping it minimal and professional.
